## {{page.title}}

After loading and describing their input data,
users will want to select which data to use
for a specific analysis. This section describes
the widgets that support such selection activities,
which are found at the top of many appStep pages.

Modules described in this section
assume you have used the `sourceFileUpload`
and in most cases `assignSamples` appSteps in your app, as
is recommended unless you have unusual needs.
