This is the documentation for the **MDI apps framework**,
which provides support code for the development of 
MDI R Shiny apps. It describes the functions and structures
defined by the framework that you can draw on to help you
create robust apps more quickly.

Documentation here will try not to repeat the 
descriptions of an MDI tools suite provided in the 
[documentation for the mdi-suite-template](/mdi-suite-template) 
- please read that first.
