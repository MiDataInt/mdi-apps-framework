This is the documentation for the **MDI apps framework**,
which provides support code for the development of 
MDI R Shiny apps. It describes the functions and structures
defined by the framework that you can draw on to help you
create robust apps more quickly.

### Other important references

Information here will not repeat the 
descriptions of an MDI tools suite provided in the 
[documentation for the mdi-suite-template](/mdi-suite-template) - 
please read that first.

In addition, you can and should clone the
[mdi-apps-framework repository](https://github.com/MiDataInt/mdi-apps-framework)
for examination alongside your own tool suite code 
(hint: use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)).
An experienced developer might find it easier to understand 
certain things by looking at the source code for a widget, etc.
