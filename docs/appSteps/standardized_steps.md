## {{page.title}}

This section describes the early step modules provided 
by the MDI apps framework that are
used by many apps to load data and structure samples
into experimental sets for further analysis.

These modules are agnostic to the nature of the samples
or analyses your app will handle. Instead, they satisfy
common needs of many data analysis tasks that are independent
of specific purposes.

If these modules don't meet your needs, you can either
replace them with your own modules, using these as a 
template to get started, or help to modify the
standardized modules to be more comprehensive by contributing
to the 
[mdi-apps-framework repository](https://github.com/MiDataInt/mdi-apps-framework).
