The MDI Stage 2 Apps framework is intended to support
apps written in a stepwise structure corresponding to tabs
on the leftmost sidebar. This reproducible organization 
makes it easy for users to understand how to use your app in
an organized fashion. 

App steps can be obligatorily sequential, but don't have to be.
Even for non-sequential activities, tab-based organization
is helpful and simplifying.

Many apps will use the same appStep module(s) for the first tab(s),
as these are designed to be generally useful for loading and structuring
data analyses without respect to the work being done. Later tabs
are typically specific your your app and data analyses - much of your work
can be focused on writing those modules.
