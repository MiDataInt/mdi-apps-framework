The MDI apps framework has a series of helpers
that make it easy to write code for
new apps.

For the most part, the framework features described in this section
do not generate specific elements of a production app's UI, 
but are either used internally in your app's code 
or provide on-screen or logging tools to aid in app code debugging, etc.
