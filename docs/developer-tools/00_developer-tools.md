The MDI apps framework has a series of helpers
that make it easy to write code for
new apps, which are described in this section.

For the most part, these framework features 
do not generate specific elements of a production app's UI, 
but are either used internally in your app's code 
or provide on-screen or logging tools to aid in app debugging, etc.
