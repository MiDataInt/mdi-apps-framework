The apps framework provides an extensive set of tools
to help you rapidly get highly functional, interactive
data display elements into your app.  Commonly, such
UI elements are known as 'widgets'.

Most MDI widgets are wrappers around other web libraries,
whether R Shiny libraries or javascript libraries such as 
[plotly](https://plotly.com/r/). 
We have usually simplified the option set, optimized them
for used in an MDI app, and tuned them to the common needs 
of many research applications.

You do not need to use our widgets - feel free to use whatever 
methods for data display you know and like - but consider them
as they are proven useful in well-tested code.
