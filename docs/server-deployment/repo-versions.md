An important goal of the MDI is promote software version
tracking so that people can know what code they
used and go back to repeat analyses with the same code.

To facilitate this, the MDI apps frameworks
displays the current versions of all relevant code,
including the app, the tool suite, and the apps framework.
It further puts the version into all saved bookmarks.

### TODO: Pending feature enhancements

A pending development will allow users to change
app versions from within the running app, and
when they load a bookmark.
