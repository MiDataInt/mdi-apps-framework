## {{page.title}}

This section gives a briefer explanation of a series
of additional miscellaneous features of the MDI
apps framework that can make it easier to write apps quickly. 

As throughout, none are essential and you can
achieve many of the same things without using these
modules and utilities. Choose what works best for you.

If you have a utilities library you particularly like,
remember that you can always 
[require an R data package]()
for your tool suite or app.
