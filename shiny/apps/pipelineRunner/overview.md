The Pipeline Runner app helps you set options in order to run a Stage 1 
data analysis pipeline on one or more input data files. Those files are 
typically large, raw, i.e., unprocessed data, but could be be anything 
suitable for a given pipeline.

You can run the pipelines on this web server or, if supported by the 
computer running this web page, submit your pipeline jobs to a cluster
job scheduler.

The Pipeline Runner further helps you monitor the status of running jobs 
via this web page.

The ultimate output of a Stage 1 Pipeline is an MDI data package
suitable for interactive analysis in Stage 2 apps.
