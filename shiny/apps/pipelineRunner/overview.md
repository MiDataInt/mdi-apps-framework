The Pipeline Runner app helps you set options to run a Stage 1 
data analysis pipeline on one or more input data files. Those files are 
typically large, with raw, i.e., unprocessed data, but could be be anything 
suitable for a given pipeline.

You can run pipeline jobs on this web server or, if supported by the 
computer running this web page, submit your work to a cluster
job scheduler.

Pipeline Runner also helps you monitor the status of submitted jobs 
via this web page.

The output of a Stage 1 Pipeline is typically a data package
suitable for interactive analysis in one or more Stage 2 Apps
&#8211; you can download your package file using Pipeline Runner 
once a job is complete.
