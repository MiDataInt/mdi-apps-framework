The Advanced Genomics Core returns data to you encapsulated in "projects",
i.e. collections of samples that you submitted together and that were run
together on our instruments.

The most basic form for your data are "raw" data files that have not
yet been subjected to downstream analysis, typically FASTQ
sequence files. Such files must be subjected to a data analysis pipeline,
which we refer to as "stage 1" pipelines.

The pipelineRunner app helps you set the pipeline options for a collection
of raw data files so that they can be easily run through one of our
standardized stage 1 analysis pipelines, known as 'magc-pipelines'.

Stage 2 analyses are executed by other MAGC Portal apps on the package
files that are the output of the Stage 1 pipelines.
