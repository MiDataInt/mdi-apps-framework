The MiData Portal provides access to various data analysis pipelines and apps.
To use our public server you must log in via Globus, typically
using your University credentials.

**What is Globus?**

Globus is a web-based service for
<a href="https://www.globus.org/data-transfer" target="_globus">
fast and reliable data transfer</a>.
We use it to transfer unprocessed data to you and you can use it
to import processed files into the Portal.
However, login is required even if you will not transfer data.

**How do I log in / get an account?**

Simply click on the button below and find your
University or organization in the drop down menu. Click
'Continue' and log in as you normally do.

If it is your first time using Globus, you will be prompted
to give permissions to the MiData Portal and for additional
information to set up your account. That's it!
