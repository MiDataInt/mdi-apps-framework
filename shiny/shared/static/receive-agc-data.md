We use
<a href="https://www.globus.org/data-transfer" target="_globus">
the Globus file transfer service</a>
to move data from our sequencing center to disk drives
you can access for use and long term, stable storage.

We cannot stress enough that you MUST have a storage
solution that will allow you to stably maintain your data
over time. Modern sequencers generate a LOT of data that
you simply cannot reliably or efficiently handle the same
way that you move PDFs and other documents.

**Step #1 - Establish a high peformance storage solution**

HITS RPC etc.

**Step #2 - Create an endpoint to your storage on Globus**

Instructions

**Step #3 - Grant the AGC staff and the MAGC Portal access to your endpoint**
