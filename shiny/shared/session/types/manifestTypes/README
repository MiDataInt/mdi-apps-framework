set the expected manifest file metadata and handling functions
used by sourceFileUpload and potentially other modules

all manifestTypes must define a list with members:

   patterns = file suffixes for the manifest files
   
   load = a function to read the manifest file from disk
   
   parse = a function that takes the data frame from 'load' and returns a list of two data frames
        $manifest = data frame with all input rows, potentially with modified column names/data types
        $unique   = data frame with one row per unique sample
        each with:
            appropriately modified/aggregated sampleValueColumns
            Project, SampleID and Description columns
                these three must ALWAYS be present as they create sample UIDs
                create them and fill with a constant if necesssary
        $unique may additionally have:
            Yield and Quality columns, when appropriate (will be set to NA if absent)
