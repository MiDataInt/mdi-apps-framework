This folder carries the template pipeline and app 
that are used by the addMdiTools module to create new tools.

They are a bit simpler than the _template pipeline and app
in the MDI suite template, which have a seconary
purpose of creating the demo tools.

Here the templates are designed to be just what is needed to
get most tools started quickly.
